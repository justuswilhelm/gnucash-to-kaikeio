## Decimals

Technically, since Japanese Yen doesn't use decimals, we don't need to use
the Decimal type. But, on the other hand, the ergonimics of converting strings
into Decimals are pretty nice. Yes, using int will prevent us from accidentally
introducing decimal separators into our csv, but that hasn't happened so far
