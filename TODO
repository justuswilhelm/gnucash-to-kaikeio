# TODO

- Add py test
- Force complexity down
- Allow specifying start number
- Parse guids as 16 byte uuids
- Join everything into splits table and process information from there. That
way we only need one SQL query for everything

# Won't do for now

## Decimals

Technically, since Japanese Yen doesn't use decimals, we don't need to use
the Decimal type. But, on the other hand, the ergonimics of converting strings
into Decimals are pretty nice. Yes, using int will prevent us from accidentally
introducing decimal separators into our csv, but that hasn't happened so far
