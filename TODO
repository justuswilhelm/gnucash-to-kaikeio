# TODO

- Add py test
- Add sample config / sample input and output
- Force complexity down
- Write original values into JournalEntry (date etc.) and only serialize them
when writing to csv
- Allow specifying start and end date
- Allow specifying start number
- Make account codes nullable
- Link splits or transactions to gnu cash accounts, not linked accounts
- Technically, since Japanese Yen doesn't use decimals, we don't need to use
the DECIMAL type
